# CONTRIBUTING

## Contributing to ReactAgent

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to ReactAgent!&#x20;

All kinds of contributions are valuable to us. In this guide, we will cover how you can quickly onboard and make your first contribution.

### Submitting an issue

You can open a new issue with this issue form.

While we want to fix all the issues, before fixing a bug we need to be able to reproduce and confirm it. Please provide us with a minimal reproduction scenario using a repository or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us the information without asking questions back & forth with additional questions like:

* 3rd-party libraries being used and their versions
* a use-case that fails

Without said minimal reproduction, we won't be able to investigate all issues, and the issue might not be resolved.

### Pull Request

We encourage contributions to ReactAgent's open-source codebase! When contributing, consider first discussing your desired change with our team via GitHub issues or Discord.

When you feel ready, you can compare the 2 branches to discuss and review changes through the New Pull Request

### Missing a Feature?

If a feature is missing, you can directly _request_ a new one here. You also can do the same by choosing "ðŸš€ Feature" when raising a New Issue on our GitHub Repository. If you would like to _implement_ it, an issue with your proposal must be submitted first, to be sure that we can use it. Please consider the guidelines given below.

### Coding guidelines

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, please keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
* We use [Eslint default rule guide](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/), with minor changes. An automated formatter is available using prettier.
