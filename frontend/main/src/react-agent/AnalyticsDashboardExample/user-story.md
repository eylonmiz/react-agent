Title: Analytics Dashboard for SaaS Subscription Platform

User Story:
As a product manager, I want to create an intuitive and informative analytics dashboard for our SaaS subscription platform, so that our users can easily track and analyze their subscription data, enabling them to make informed decisions and improve their business.

Description:
The Analytics Dashboard will provide users with a comprehensive view of their subscription data, including total revenue, number of subscriptions, sales, and active users. The dashboard will be divided into three main sections: Header, DashboardContent, and Tabs, with each section containing various components to present the data effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Header:
   a. TeamSwitcher: Allows users to switch between different teams.
   b. DashboardNav: Provides easy navigation to different sections of the dashboard.
   c. HeaderActions: Provides a search input for users to search within the dashboard, and a user navigation menu to access account settings.

2. DashboardContent:
   a. SubHeader: Displays a descriptive title and allows users to select a date range for their data and download the data in a specific format.
   
   b. Tabs: Organizes the dashboard data into two main sections:
      i. SmallCardsContainer: Displays an overview of key metrics like total revenue, number of subscriptions, sales, and active users.
      
      ii. BigCardsContainer: Presents more detailed data in two cards, OverviewCard and RecentSalesCard. OverviewCard will display a visual representation of the subscription data, while RecentSalesCard will show a list of recent sales.

3. Responsiveness: The dashboard must be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices.

Out of Scope:
1. Integration with other platforms or third-party services.
2. Real-time updates of data; the dashboard will be based on the selected date range.

Dependencies:
1. Backend API to fetch the required data for the dashboard.
2. Design team to provide UI/UX designs and assets.

Milestones:
1. Finalize the dashboard requirements and acceptance criteria.
2. Design team to complete UI/UX designs and assets.
3. Development team to implement the frontend and integrate with backend APIs.
4. QA team to test the dashboard for functionality and responsiveness.
5. Deployment of the analytics dashboard to the production environment.
