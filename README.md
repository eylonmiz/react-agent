## üìñ Introduction
ReactAgent is an experimental autonomous agent that uses GPT-4 language model to generate and compose React components from user stories. It is built with React, TailwindCSS, Typescript, Radix UI, Shandcn UI, and OpenAI API.

## üöÄ Features
- Generate React Components from user stories
- Compose React Components from existing components
- Use a local design system to generate React Components
- Use React, TailwindCSS, Typescript, Radix UI, Shadcn UI
- Built with Atomic Design Principles

## üòÆ Example

## üåà Quickstart
1. Clone repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:eylonmiz/react-agent.git
```
2. Change to the project directory
```bash
cd react-agent
```
3. Get an OpenAI [API Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
4. Set OPENAI_SECRET_KEY in backend/main .env file (see .env.example) or run the script below
```bash
echo OPENAI_SECRET_KEY="INSERT_YOUR_OPENAI_SECRET_KEY_VALUE_HERE" >> backend/main/.env
```
5. Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```
6. Run Backend Script - This script generates the components
```bash
yarn backend:dev
```
7. Run Frontend App to see your components in action
```bash
yarn frontend:dev
```
8. Open frontend/main/src/GenReactApp.tsx
```bash
Read the instructions and change the example component to the component you generated
```
9. Read Project Customization Section
```bash
Read the Project Customization Section to learn how to customize and operate the project
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Customization
1. Customize workflow:
   - file: backend/main/react-agent/generateComponents.ts
   - description: Can control the flow of the generation process, run step by step or full flow.
2. Render Application
   - file: frontend/main/src/GenReactApp.tsx
   - description: Render the generated application, see examples in the file.
     - use JsonSkeleton to render the skeleton of the page
     - use demo.tsx files to render the demo page
3. Generate React Components
   - folder: create a folder under LOCAL_COMPONENTS_DIR (default frontend/main/src/react-agent) (see .env.example file)
   - description: Generate a user-story.md file under the folder, make it as detailed as possible.
   - change CONTAINER_PATH in generateComponents.ts to the folder name
   - run the backend script to generate the React Components.
4. Customize Folder Structure (see .env.example file)
   - UI_COMPONENTS_DIR - Where your UI components are located
   - DEMO_COMPONENTS_DIR - Where your UI components demo files are located
   - LOCAL_COMPONENTS_DIR - Where your generated components are located


## üì¶ Next Steps
- Edit existing components
- Test Components after generating
- Wireframe image to skeleton code
- Remote design system to generate React Components
- Use of external libraries
- Component logic control (state, props, context, effects, api calls, etc.)
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- The generated code is not production-ready and should be used for prototyping purposes only.
- Only works well with GPT4, GPT-3.5 is not supported ATM, so make sure you have GPT4 enabled in your OpenAI account.
- The output may come with a few bugs and errors, so it is recommended to review and test the code before using it in a production environment, or even running it in a development environment.
- The first step of the generation process is to convert the user story into a JSON file. This step is not perfect and may result in some inaccuracies or missing information, consider changing the JSON file manually if necessary.
- Advised to run it step by step, and review the generated code after each step.
